- Java Memory Model and visibility of shared data.

The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines how threads interact through memory and establishes rules for visibility and ordering of variable accesses. It ensures that changes made by one thread to shared variables are visible to other threads under certain conditions.
To ensure visibility, you can use volatile variables, which guarantee that any read or write to the variable is directly done in the main memory, thus making the latest value visible to all threads. Additionally, synchronization constructs like synchronized blocks and locks provide both visibility and atomicity, ensuring that changes are visible and that threads do not interfere with each other. In essence, the JMM provides a framework for understanding how Java manages memory in a concurrent environment, ensuring consistency and correctness of shared data.


synchronized

A synchronized method locks the object for the duration of the method execution, ensuring that only one thread can execute it at a time. This is done by using the synchronized keyword in the method signature.
On the other hand, synchronized blocks allow more granular control over locking. You can specify the block of code to be synchronized and the object on which to acquire the lock, enabling you to limit the scope of synchronization to just the critical section. This can improve performance by reducing contention on the entire method when only a small part of it requires synchronization.
Both techniques ensure that changes made by one thread to shared data are visible to others, maintaining data integrity in a concurrent environment.


ReentrantLock


ReentrantLock in Java provides more advanced locking capabilities compared to synchronized methods and blocks. It allows for finer control over thread synchronization. One of its key features is that it supports fair and unfair locking. With a fair lock, threads acquire access in the order they requested it, while an unfair lock allows threads to acquire the lock out of order, potentially improving throughput.
Additionally, ReentrantLock provides features like lock acquisition with timeouts, allowing a thread to attempt to acquire the lock and fail if it's not available within a specified duration. It also supports multiple condition variables through the Condition interface, which enables more complex signaling between threads. This flexibility makes ReentrantLock a powerful tool for managing concurrency, allowing for more sophisticated thread coordination and reducing the likelihood of deadlocks and other synchronization issues.


Deadlock, livelock, and how to avoid them. in short


Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. Livelock, on the other hand, happens when threads are actively changing states in response to each other but still cannot proceed, effectively "spinning" without making progress. To avoid deadlock, you can implement strategies like acquiring locks in a consistent global order, using timeout mechanisms to back off when a lock cannot be acquired, or employing deadlock detection algorithms. To prevent livelock, ensure that threads have a way to break out of repeated states, such as adding randomness or introducing a backoff mechanism when contention occurs. Overall, careful design of resource allocation and lock management is essential to mitigate both issues.


ConcurrentHashMap


ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe variant of HashMap that allows concurrent access from multiple threads without the need for external synchronization.
Segmented Locking: Instead of locking the entire map, ConcurrentHashMap divides the map into segments. Each segment can be locked independently, allowing multiple threads to read and write to different segments simultaneously.
High Throughput: It allows for high concurrency by supporting concurrent reads and updates, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
Null Values: Unlike HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap does not allow null keys or values.
Iterators: The iterators provided by ConcurrentHashMap are weakly consistent, meaning they reflect the state of the map at the time of the iterator's creation and do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.
Use Cases: It's ideal for scenarios where you need a highly concurrent data structure, such as caching or maintaining shared state among multiple threads.


CopyOnWriteArrayList
CopyOnWriteArrayList is a thread-safe variant of ArrayList that is optimized for scenarios where reads are far more frequent than writes.
Immutable Snapshots: On every write operation (add, set, remove), CopyOnWriteArrayList creates a new copy of the underlying array. This allows iterators to operate on a stable snapshot of the list without being affected by concurrent modifications.
Safe Iteration: Because writes create a new array, iterators can safely iterate over the list without worrying about concurrent modifications, making it suitable for read-heavy scenarios.
Performance Consideration: While reads are fast and thread-safe, writes can be slower due to the overhead of copying the array.
Use Cases: It’s particularly useful in cases where reads outnumber writes, such as in event handling or scenarios with frequent reads and infrequent updates.

This is a thread-safe variant of ArrayList. It creates a new copy of the underlying array on each write operation (e.g., add, set, remove), which allows multiple threads to read from the list concurrently without blocking.
Safe for iteration without external synchronization, since it provides a stable snapshot of the list.
Suitable for scenarios where reads significantly outnumber writes



The main differences between Collection and ConcurrentCollection in Java lie in thread safety and performance.
Collection, which includes implementations like ArrayList and HashSet, is not thread-safe. This means that when multiple threads access a Collection concurrently, it can lead to data inconsistency or exceptions, such as ConcurrentModificationException. In contrast, ConcurrentCollection, such as ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList, is designed specifically for concurrent access. These collections handle internal synchronization, allowing multiple threads to read and write safely without causing data corruption.
In terms of performance, non-concurrent collections can be faster in single-threaded scenarios, as they don’t have the overhead of synchronization. However, they require external synchronization in multi-threaded environments, which can be cumbersome. Concurrent collections optimize for high concurrency, often using techniques like segmented locking or copy-on-write, making them more suitable for applications where multiple threads need to access shared data simultaneously.
In summary, choose Collection for single-threaded use and ConcurrentCollection for scenarios involving multiple threads.



Executor is a simple interface that provides a way to decouple task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run. It defines a method for executing a Runnable or Callable task, allowing for flexible task execution without having to manage threads directly.


ExecutorService extends Executor and adds features for managing and controlling the lifecycle of threads. It allows for the submission of tasks and provides methods to manage termination, such as shutdown() and awaitTermination(). It also supports returning results through Future, enabling you to retrieve the result of asynchronous computations.



ScheduledExecutorService is a specialized extension of ExecutorService that allows for the scheduling of tasks to run after a delay or periodically. It provides methods like schedule(), scheduleAtFixedRate(), and scheduleWithFixedDelay(), making it ideal for scenarios where you need to execute tasks at specific intervals or after a certain delay.
In summary, Executor is for simple task execution, ExecutorService manages the execution and lifecycle of tasks, and ScheduledExecutorService adds scheduling capabilities for timed tasks. These abstractions greatly simplify concurrent programming in Java.



Fixed Thread Pool: This type maintains a fixed number of threads in the pool. When tasks are submitted, they are queued if all threads are busy. This helps control resource usage and is useful for applications with predictable workloads.

Cached Thread Pool: A cached thread pool can create new threads as needed and reuse previously constructed threads when they are available. If a thread is idle for 60 seconds, it is terminated. This type is ideal for applications with a large number of short-lived tasks, as it can quickly adapt to varying workloads.

Single-threaded Pool: This pool contains only a single worker thread. Tasks are executed sequentially, making it suitable for scenarios where tasks need to be executed in a strict order or when thread safety is a concern.

Scheduled Thread Pool: This type is designed for scheduling tasks to run after a delay or periodically. It can execute tasks at fixed rates or with fixed delays, making it ideal for background tasks like polling or periodic data processing.






How to submit tasks and handle results using Future.
To submit tasks and handle results using Future in Java, you typically follow these steps:

Create an ExecutorService: Use Executors to create a thread pool. For example, you can create a fixed thread pool with Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads).

Submit Tasks: You can submit tasks to the executor service using the submit() method, which accepts a Callable or Runnable. The submit() method returns a Future object, which represents the result of the computation.

Handle Results: You can use the Future object to check the status of the task and retrieve its result:
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
Use future.isDone() to check if the task has completed.
Call future.get() to obtain the result. This method blocks until the computation is complete and returns the result of the task.
Exception Handling: If the task throws an exception, calling get() will throw an ExecutionException. You can handle this to deal with any errors that occurred during task execution.
